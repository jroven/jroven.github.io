This program includes a database of the scores of each country competing in each year of the Eurovision Song Contest.
The stats by country can be accessed by running esc_main.py. The program computes the average score for each country
competing within the time frame given and ranks them in order. Because each year saw a different number of countries
competing, scores have been normalized to be out of 40, where first place is always 1 and last place is always 40.
As of 2022, the country with the best average score since the contest began in 1956 is Ukraine.
