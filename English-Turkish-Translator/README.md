This is a translator that translates simple English sentences into Turkish. The main translator can be accessed by
running sentence.py. The translator will prompt you to enter a sentence in English and it will return the Turkish
equivalent. The translator currently supports nouns with determiners as the subject and object of the sentence, along
with present progressive, simple past, and definite future tenses.
